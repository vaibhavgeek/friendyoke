<div style="padding-left:15px; vertical-align:top;"><h1>What Is 'Follow Public Profie ' ??</h1>
<p style="font-size: large">follow box is something where you can follow your Role Models OR the people you aspire .. In any soacial networking website you cannot expect guys like Bill Gates or Warren Buffet to accept your connect request but still you want there activities to be shared with , on friendyoke we offer a complete new thing known as "Add to Box" . You can add your intrests , role models on this website and the best thing is it does not messes up with the connections newsfeed (unlike facebook) . That remains clean :) . I Hope u enjoy this feature of frindyoke , you can also give any suggestions and ideas on our suggestion Box. Happy Yoking . <br />
